== Description ==

**Boost sales by using affiliates**

Having trusted affiliates refer customers to your store is a sure way to increase sales.

**Starting an affiliates program has never been easier!**

Track sales, award commissions, and more! Your WooCommerce store can increase sales by having affiliates sending customers your way.

**How it works**
To get started, create your first affiliate by clicking on Create an Affiliate. Then send the affiliate their very own link. When a customer visits your site using this link the affiliate will be awarded a commission. It's a win-win!

**Affiliates Report**
Let the affiliates log in and track their own stats. Just link an Affiliate to a WordPress user.

**Transparent Tracking**
View reports by affiliate to monitor results. Pro version includes reporting by product.

**Simple Setup**
Running an affiliates program should not be difficult. PW WooCommerce Affiliates makes it straight-forward with easy to use screens. By default, commmissions are based upon the product subtotal before shipping and taxes.

**Export**
Export your affiliate report into CSV format.

**Multilingual**
Translations included for German, Spanish, French, Italian, Dutch, and Russian.
